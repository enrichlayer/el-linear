# Linear Operations Skill

All Linear operations should go through the **`el-linear` CLI**. For command syntax, run `el-linear usage` (all commands) or `el-linear <command> --help`.

This skill covers **mandatory processes and non-obvious rules** — everything the CLI help doesn't tell you.

> **Team-specific overrides.** Many teams keep their own issue-creation guide, label taxonomy, or member alias map. If your project has a `CLAUDE.md` or sibling skill that supplements this one, treat its rules as authoritative on top of these defaults.

## Output formats — use `--format summary` for terminals and agents

`el-linear` defaults to a structured JSON envelope. **For human-readable or chat-bound output, always pass `--format summary`.** Do not pipe el-linear through `python -c "json.load(...)"` or `jq` to pull out title / state / assignee — that is exactly what `--format summary` is for, and it produces a stable rendering across releases.

```bash
el-linear issues read DEV-123 --format summary
# DEV-123  Fix login flicker on Safari 17
# State:    In Progress
# Assignee: Alice
# Project:  Auth Refactor
# Labels:   Feature, tool
# URL:      https://linear.app/acme/issue/DEV-123/...

el-linear issues search "auth" --format summary
# ID        TITLE                                                    STATE        ASSIGNEE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DEV-100   Migrate auth middleware to new session store             In Progress  Alice
# DEV-104   Auth callback returns 502 under load                     Todo         Bob
#
# 2 issues
```

Use `--format json` (the default — pass nothing) **only** when you genuinely need the full envelope: writing scripts that parse the response, mutating with `--jq`, or chaining into another tool that expects structured data. Default to summary; reach for JSON when the task warrants it.

### Anti-patterns to avoid

If you find yourself writing any of these, you are reaching for the wrong tool:

```bash
# ❌ Don't do this — pipe through python to extract a few fields
el-linear issues search "..." --limit 10 2>&1 | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); ..."

# ❌ Don't do this either — head the JSON to make it manageable
el-linear projects list --limit 50 2>&1 | head -100

# ❌ Don't reach for jq just to print title + state
el-linear issues read DEV-123 --jq '.title + " " + .state.name' 2>&1

# ❌ Don't pipe a read through python just to get the whole description body
el-linear issues read DEV-123 --format json 2>&1 | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['description'])"

# ❌ Don't grep a write's JSON for the new state / url
el-linear issues update DEV-123 --status Done 2>&1 | grep -iE 'state|url'

# ✅ Just use --format summary
el-linear issues search "..." --limit 10 --format summary 2>&1
el-linear projects list --limit 50 --format summary 2>&1
el-linear issues read DEV-123 --format summary 2>&1

# ✅ Whole description as raw text → --body. Terse write confirmation → --quiet
el-linear issues read DEV-123 --body 2>&1
el-linear comments read comment-c5d15b28 --body 2>&1
el-linear comments list DEV-123 --body 2>&1
el-linear comments list DEV-123 --format summary --no-truncate 2>&1
el-linear issues update DEV-123 --status Done --quiet 2>&1
```

The summary formatter exists exactly because every consumer (humans and LLMs) was reinventing the same `python -c` / `jq` extraction in shell. Pick the canonical path; the per-resource format is a stable contract.

### Extracting one description section: `--field`

When you need a single named section out of an issue's markdown description (e.g. "Done when", "Out of scope", "Why we need this"), use `issues read --field`. It matches `##`/`###` headers and bold pseudo-headers (`**Done when**`) case-insensitively, prints just that section's text, and exits non-zero when the section is missing — the canonical replacement for piping into `python3 -c "...desc.find(...)"`.

```bash
# ✅ One section, plain text, scriptable
el-linear issues read DEV-123 --field "Done when" 2>&1

# ❌ Don't do this
el-linear issues read DEV-123 2>&1 | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['description'].split('## Done when')[1].split('##')[0])"
```

`--field` is single-issue only — for batch extraction, fall back to `--jq` on the full JSON.

### The whole description as raw text: `--body`

When you want the **entire** description (not one section) as plain markdown — to read it, diff it, or pipe it to a file — use `issues read --body`. It prints the raw description with real newlines and no JSON envelope, single-issue only, and exits non-zero when the issue has no description. This is the canonical replacement for `... --format json | python3 -c "...['description']"` and the `sed 's/\\n/\n/g'` newline-unescaping hack.

```bash
# ✅ Full description, raw markdown, scriptable
el-linear issues read DEV-123 --body 2>&1

# ❌ Don't do this
el-linear issues read DEV-123 --format json 2>&1 | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['description'])"
```

`--body` is mutually exclusive with `--field` / `--sections` / `--with` (those extract named parts or extend the JSON envelope; `--body` is the whole thing as text).

### Comment reads and full comment bodies

When you need a specific comment, or the full text of a long comment, use the
comments read/list surfaces instead of dumping JSON:

```bash
# ✅ Resolve a Linear permalink anchor or full comment UUID
el-linear comments read comment-c5d15b28 --format summary 2>&1
el-linear comments read comment-c5d15b28 --body 2>&1

# ✅ Full bodies for every comment on an issue
el-linear comments list DEV-123 --body 2>&1
el-linear comments list DEV-123 --format summary --no-truncate 2>&1

# ❌ Don't do this
el-linear comments list DEV-123 --format json 2>&1 | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['data'][0]['body'])"
```

`comments read` accepts a full UUID, `comment-<hash>`, or a URL containing
`#comment-<hash>`. `comments list --format summary` includes each comment id
so you can copy it straight into `comments read`.

### Attachment reads and downloads

List attachments first, then use the attachment ID or exact title. Text files
can be streamed directly; binary files require an explicit download path.

```bash
el-linear attachments list DEV-123 --format summary
el-linear attachments read DEV-123 <attachment-id>
el-linear attachments download DEV-123 <attachment-id> --output /tmp/report.pdf
```

Do not reconstruct authenticated `curl` commands from attachment URLs. The
attachment commands use the active Linear profile and reject binary stdout.

### Terse write confirmations: `-q, --quiet`

`issues create|update` and `comments create|update` accept `-q, --quiet`, which prints a single machine-stable confirmation line instead of the full JSON envelope — no need to `grep` the result for the identifier / state / url:

```bash
el-linear issues update DEV-123 --status "In Review" --quiet 2>&1
# DEV-123  In Review  https://linear.app/acme/issue/DEV-123/...

el-linear comments create DEV-123 --body "..." --quiet 2>&1
# comment <id>
```

`--quiet` overrides `--format` (it's the whole point) and is independent of `--fields`/`--jq`.

### When you must reach outside el-linear: prefer `jq` over `python3 -c`

For tools that aren't `el-linear` (e.g. `gh`, `glab`, `kubectl`), prefer `jq` for JSON extraction in one-shot shell commands. `python3 -c "import json,sys; ..."` produces longer, harder-to-read pipelines, and tends to attract incremental complexity (try/except, fallbacks) that `jq` handles inline. Reach for python only when the transformation genuinely needs control flow that's painful in `jq` (e.g. multi-step assembly with intermediate state).

### Coverage

`--format summary` is implemented for:

- **Single resources:** `issues read`, `comments read`, `projects read`, `cycles read`, `project-milestones read`, `project-updates read`, `documents read`, `templates read`, releases (`graphql` query results), `users read`
- **Lists:** `issues list`, `issues search`, `projects list`, `comments list`, `cycles list`, `project-milestones list`, `project-updates list`, `labels list`, `teams list`, `users list`, `documents list`, `templates list`, `attachments list`, `releases list`, and the cross-resource `search` command

Commands without a dedicated formatter (e.g. `config show`, custom `graphql` queries) fall back to a generic key/value rendering of their JSON payload.

## Intent-Driven Issue Writing

Every issue should communicate **why** the work matters and **what** success looks like. This creates a track record of reasoning and gives the assignee room to find better solutions.

### Principles

1. **Lead with intent.** Start with why this work matters. The "Why we need this" section should explain real motivation (business problem, user pain, strategic context) — not restate the title.
2. **Describe outcomes.** "Done when" criteria describe what success looks like. The assignee may find a more elegant path than the one you'd prescribe.
3. **Respect expertise.** Provide context the assignee might lack (what a tool is, links to docs, business reasoning). Specific instructions are fine when you have relevant domain knowledge — but always pair them with the intent so the assignee understands the goal behind them.

### Example

```markdown
## Set up a self-hosted CRM

The team needs a CRM to replace fragmented contact tracking
(spreadsheets + Linear + memory). Should be production-ready:
reliable, backed up, accessible.

## Why we need this
As we scale outbound, we need customer relationships, pipeline,
and outreach tracked in one place.

## Done when
- Team can access the CRM UI and create/edit contacts.
- Data survives a server restart.
- Accessible via a subdomain with TLS.
```

## Duplicate & Related Issues Check (MANDATORY)

**Search before creating. No exceptions.**

> **Now enforced at the CLI ([DEV-4823](https://linear.app/verticalint/issue/DEV-4823/)).** `el-linear issues create` runs a deterministic
> duplicate-detection gate *before* the create POST: it tokenizes the title,
> searches the salient keywords (including closed issues), scores candidates
> by Jaccard title-overlap, and **blocks (exit non-zero) — listing the
> matches (id · title · state · assignee)** — when one crosses the similarity
> threshold (default `0.35`, set `validation.duplicateThreshold` to tune). This
> is the deterministic backstop for the manual check below — don't skip the
> manual review just because the gate exists (it catches title-keyword dupes,
> not semantic ones with different wording). To proceed past a flagged dupe,
> use `--allow-duplicate` (the narrow, correct flag for this gate);
> `--skip-validation` also bypasses it but skips all field validation too, so
> prefer `--allow-duplicate`. Disable just the gate with
> `validation.duplicateDetection: false` (field validation still runs);
> `validation.enabled: false` turns off all validation.

> **SOP-label parent gate ([DEV-5378](https://linear.app/verticalint/issue/DEV-5378/), opt-in).** When enabled, `el-linear issues create` requires an
> issue carrying an **SOP-type label** (any name in `validation.sopLabels`,
> default `["SOP"]`, case-insensitive) to point at a **parent SOP** — `--parent`
> or `--related-to` must resolve to another SOP-labeled issue — and **blocks
> (exit non-zero)** otherwise, naming the rule. An SOP with no parent SOP is
> unfindable by SOP tooling and breaks the catalog topology. It is **off by
> default** (`validation.sopLabelParentGate: true` turns it on; the Enrich Layer
> shared team config flips it on) because "SOP" is a workspace-specific
> taxonomy, not something an open-source install should assume. Escape hatch:
> `--allow-unparented-sop` (narrow, for an intentionally top-level SOP);
> `--skip-validation` also bypasses it but skips all field validation. A typo'd
> or nonexistent parent reference **blocks** (naming the ref) so a mistake can't
> orphan an SOP; a transport/service error **fails open** with a warning (and a
> `fail-open` gate event); a resolvable non-SOP parent hard-blocks.

```bash
# --include-closed is required so previously-completed duplicates surface.
# `issues search` defaults to open states (DEV-4478); the duplicate check
# intentionally widens to Done/Canceled because a closed-out duplicate is
# still a duplicate. (`issues create` runs this same widened search itself
# as the DEV-4823 gate — this manual step is for the semantic/judgment pass.)
el-linear issues search "keywords from proposed title" --include-closed 2>&1
```

1. Extract 2–3 key terms from the proposed title (skip generic words).
2. Review results — classify each match:
   - Same component + same problem = **duplicate** → comment on existing issue, don't create.
   - Same component + different problem = **related** → create new issue with `--related-to`.
   - Same domain but different component = **related** → create new issue with `--related-to`.
   - Unrelated = proceed without linking.
3. If a potential duplicate is found: show the user the existing issue(s), ask whether to comment, mark duplicate, or proceed.
4. If related issues are found, **always create the relation** when creating the new issue:

   ```bash
   el-linear issues create "Title" --team ENG --related-to "ENG-456,ENG-789" ... 2>&1
   ```

### Cross-linking: be generous, link proactively, don't wait ([DEV-5853](https://linear.app/verticalint/issue/DEV-5853/))

**The default is to link, not to ask.** A cross-link is cheap and reversible; a *missing* link is invisible and costs reviewers and SOP tooling the context they need. When you identify an issue that is **related** / a **blocker** / a **follow-up** / the **origin** of the work in front of you, create the relation yourself — don't stage the candidates and wait for the human to name them, and don't hedge with "tell me if you want these linked."

- **At create time**, pass `--related-to "<ids>"` / `--parent <id>` / `--blocked-by <id>` directly on `issues create` — this path typically passes the classifier, so link generously the moment you file.
- **After the fact**, call `el-linear issues relate <source> --related-to "<ids>"` (or `--blocked-by` / `--blocks` / `--duplicate-of`) proactively, the same way.
- Over-linking is self-correcting (a wrong relation is one command to remove); under-linking is not. When in doubt, link.

The one exception is below: if the auto-mode permission classifier actually blocks a specific post-hoc `relate` call, that block — not caution — is your signal to surface the candidates for a one-word confirm.

### Existence check — before an "add capability X" issue ([DEV-5097](https://linear.app/verticalint/issue/DEV-5097/))

The dup-check above guards against duplicating an *issue*. This guards against duplicating *reality*: before filing an issue to **add** a flag / guard / command / subcommand, confirm it doesn't **already exist**.

- **`el-catalog commands --search "<intent>"`** / `el-catalog clis --search` — the **authoritative** check for a command/subcommand; it deterministically indexes every `<cli> <subcommand>`. Confirm with `<cli> <subcommand> --help` (and `<cli> --help` — a flag may be a global option absent from the subcommand's help).
- For a hook/guard, grep the source (e.g. `cli/el-hook/src/checks`) — but **empty grep output is inconclusive, not proof of absence**. A mis-quoted glob or bad flag makes grep exit silently with zero matches (`grep --include=*.ts …` errors under zsh, returning nothing for a symbol that exists). Never read a raw grep's silence as "doesn't exist" for the command check — that is exactly what `el-catalog` is for.

Skipping it cost real rework across sessions: a hook guard and `--jq`/`--fields` flags filed as "features" though both already existed and worked, and a near-duplicate `el-git` subcommand built after a raw grep silently misfired (the `el-catalog` search would have found the existing one) — every premise caught only at implementation.

When `el-linear issues search` (or the cross-resource `search`) returns rows
carrying issue identifiers, the JSON envelope embeds a `_warnings` line
starting with `relation_candidates:` enumerating the candidate IDs. Treat it
as a **convenience list of link candidates, not a stop sign** — under the
proactive default above, relate the ones that are genuinely related/blocking
without waiting to be told. Prefer create-time `--related-to` when the search
ran as part of filing a new issue (create-time relations typically pass the
classifier); otherwise call `issues relate` directly.

**Residual auto-mode constraint (the only reason to pause).** Claude Code's
auto-mode permission classifier *may* block a standalone `issues relate
--related-to "<ids>"` when it judges the IDs *agent-inferred* (surfaced by
your own search) rather than *user-specified*, because each peer is a write
target. A standing user instruction to cross-link generously is itself
authorization — so proceed by default. But if a specific `relate` call is
**actually blocked** by the classifier, that block is your cue: surface the
candidate IDs to the user for a one-word confirm, then re-run with the
user-named IDs (which pass). This is the **exception path**, not the default —
do not pre-emptively withhold links the classifier would have allowed. Two
ways to keep it frictionless: file relations at create time (`--related-to`),
or the operator adds a permission rule / runs non-auto-mode so post-hoc
`relate` never trips.

If `--include-closed` search returns no matches, no `relation_candidates:`
warning is emitted and the flow proceeds normally.

### Viewing existing relations

```bash
el-linear issues related ENG-123 2>&1
```

Returns all relations (related, blocks, blockedBy, duplicate) with direction, state, and assignee. Use this before creating follow-up work to understand the context around an issue.

### Adding relations to an existing issue

To attach a relation to an issue that **already exists** (triage, splitting findings into separate issues, backfilling related work), use `issues relate` — or pass the same flags to `issues update`:

```bash
# Dedicated relation command
el-linear issues relate ENG-123 --related-to "ENG-456,ENG-789" 2>&1
el-linear issues relate ENG-123 --blocked-by "ENG-400" 2>&1
el-linear issues relate ENG-123 --duplicate-of "ENG-111" 2>&1

# Or alongside a field update in one call
el-linear issues update ENG-123 --status "In Progress" --related-to "ENG-456" 2>&1
```

Both `issues relate` and `issues update` accept `--related-to`, `--blocks`, `--blocked-by`, and `--duplicate-of` (comma-separated identifiers; `--duplicate-of` takes a single issue). `issues create` accepts the same flags.

> **Gotcha:** `--related-to` is **not** valid on `issues update` in el-linear < 1.12. On older versions it fails with `error: unknown option '--related-to'` — use `el-linear issues relate <id> --related-to …` instead. `issues relate` has always supported it.

### Auto-linking issue references on create/update

`el-linear issues create`, `el-linear issues update`, `el-linear comments create`, and `el-linear comments update` run the same auto-linking flow on text being written:

1. **Wrap as markdown links.** Bare identifiers (`ENG-100`, `DESIGN-22`) are rewritten to `[ENG-100](https://linear.app/<workspace>/issue/ENG-100/)`. Skipped inside fenced code blocks, inline backticks, existing markdown links, angle-bracket autolinks, and bare URLs.
2. **Validate first.** Identifiers that don't resolve in the workspace (e.g. ISO codes like `ISO-1424`) are left as plain text — no link, no relation.
3. **Create sidebar relations** on the parent issue. Default is `related`. Prose keywords upgrade the type:
   - `blocked by X` / `depends on X` / `waiting on X` → `blocks` (X→source)
   - `blocks X` / `prerequisite for X` → `blocks` (source→X)
   - `duplicates X` / `duplicate of X` → `duplicate` (source→X)
   - `duplicated by X` → `duplicate` (X→source)

The output includes an `autoLinked` field with `linked`, `skipped`, and `failed` arrays.

- A reference is **skipped** when any relation already exists.
- A reference is **failed** when the identifier doesn't resolve.
- Pass `--no-auto-link` on `create`/`update` to opt out of both wrapping and sidebar relation creation.

To backfill an existing issue:

```bash
el-linear issues link-references ENG-123                      # description only
el-linear issues link-references ENG-123 --include-comments   # description + comments
el-linear issues link-references ENG-123 --dry-run            # preview
```

---

## Pre-Work Check (Existing Issues)

When starting work on an existing issue (`el-linear issues read ENG-123`):

- [ ] **Branch claim path used** — `el-linear issues create --checkout` and `el-linear issues mark-branch ENG-123` automatically claim the issue by assigning it to the current Linear user and moving it to the team's first started state. Use `--no-claim` only when intentionally creating/marking a branch on someone else's behalf.
- [ ] **Project set** — if missing, ask user and update: `el-linear issues update ENG-123 --project "<name>"`.
- [ ] **Status appropriate** — if you did not use one of the branch claim paths, move the issue to "In Progress" or your team's equivalent.

Don't start implementation work on an unassigned issue — the assignee is the person accountable. If you did not use one of the branch claim paths (or used `--no-claim`), assign the issue before proceeding.

---

## Pre-Creation Validation Checklist

Complete ALL items before creating any issue:

- [ ] **Duplicate & related check** — searched for existing issues, linked related ones (above).
- [ ] **Team** — ask user if unclear (`el-linear teams list`).
- [ ] **Assignee** — ask user if unclear (`el-linear users list --active`).
- [ ] **Project** — always ask user, never guess (`el-linear projects list`).
- [ ] **Labels** — exactly 1 type label + 1–2 domain labels (see Label Taxonomy below).
- [ ] **Title** — action verb matching the type label (see Title Verb Convention), sentence case, specific scope.
- [ ] **Description** — 2–4 sentences with context and intent, formatted with **bold** and `inline code`.
- [ ] **"Why we need this"** — genuine motivation, not a restatement of the title.

If any field is missing, **STOP and use AskUserQuestion**.

---

## The `--claude` Delegation Pattern

`el-linear issues create` accepts a `--claude` flag that applies the workspace-level "claude" label (configured at `config.labels.workspace.claude`). This is the canonical signal that an issue is **delegated to Claude Code** for autonomous execution.

```bash
el-linear issues create "Migrate auth middleware to new session store" \
  --team ENG --assignee alice --project "Auth Refactor" \
  --description "..." --claude 2>&1
```

When you see `--claude` in usage:

- **As a writer**: use it to mark issues you want Claude to pick up. The label is the contract; combine it with a clear "Done when" so Claude knows what success looks like.
- **As Claude**: if you find an issue with the `claude` label, you should treat it as in-scope work for autonomous progress. Search with `el-linear issues search "claude" --status "Todo"`.
- **As a reviewer**: an issue's `claude` label tells you to weigh whether the description has enough acceptance criteria, since the assignee can't ask follow-up questions in a back-and-forth.

The label is plain config — set it to anything you want, or skip it entirely. The flag is just sugar for `--labels claude`.

---

## User @Mentions

Reference team members by name in comments. el-linear resolves both explicit `@name` tokens and bare capitalized references to proper Linear mentions.

```bash
el-linear comments create ENG-123 --body "cc @alice — Bob can you review?" 2>&1
# Both "@alice" and "Bob" become Linear mentions.
```

- **Explicit `@name`** — always resolved. Config alias → display name → name (partial, case-insensitive) → API fallback.
- **Bare capitalized names** — auto-converted by default when they match a configured member. Config-only — no API fallback — so false positives are bounded to your team. Skipped inside inline code, code blocks, and link text. Self-references are skipped.
- **Opt out** per-invocation with `--no-auto-mention`.

Works in comments only (not descriptions).

### Confirming a mention fired (the `mentions` output field)

A real mention lives in the comment's structured `bodyData`, not in the markdown — so a comment whose body reads `@alice` may or may not have actually pinged anyone. **Don't guess: read the `mentions` field** that `comments create|update` attach to their output (the sibling of `autoLinked`):

```jsonc
{
  "id": "…",
  "mentions": {
    "resolved":   [{ "label": "alice", "userId": "…" }],  // real notifications sent
    "unresolved": ["bobby"],                                // explicit @names that matched nobody
    "delivered":  true                                      // false ⇒ Linear rejected bodyData, fell back to plain text
  }
}
```

- An **unresolved** explicit `@name` (typo or unknown handle) is left as plain text — **no notification** — and el-linear prints a loud `⚠ @name did not resolve …` warning to **stderr**. Fix the name and re-comment; never assume the ping landed.
- `delivered: false` means the structured body was rejected and the comment shipped as plain markdown, so the resolved mentions did **not** fire — also warned on stderr.
- Under `--quiet`, the stdout stays the one-line `comment <id>`; the `mentions: resolved=[…] unresolved=[…]` confirmation is echoed to **stderr**.

This makes "a real @mention" a verifiable, deterministic convention rather than a hope ([DEV-4987](https://linear.app/verticalint/issue/DEV-4987/)).

---

## CLI Syntax Rules

Run `el-linear usage` for the full command reference. Non-obvious rules:

- **Always append `2>&1`** to capture errors.
- **Labels are comma-separated** — `--labels "feature,backend"` (not repeated flags).
- **Singular/plural interchangeable** — `issues`/`issue`, `labels`/`label`, etc.
- **Subcommand aliases** — `read`/`view`/`get`/`show`, `update`/`edit`/`set`.
- **`--jq` for GraphQL filtering** — never pipe through `jq` directly (zsh escaping breaks `!=`).
- **`--raw` flag** strips the `{ data, meta }` wrapper — emits just the array.
- **Body/description/content from a file** — `issues create`/`update` take `--description-file <path>`; `comments create`/`update` take `--body-file <path>`; **`projects create`/`update` take `--content-file <path>`** (the project's full markdown **content**, not its short `description` — see the two-field gotcha under *Project Management Gotchas*). Prefer the file form for any body with backticks, fenced code, or markdown tables — it sidesteps shell-quoting traps (the same reason `el-git mr comment --body-file` exists). The inline and file flags are **mutually exclusive** (passing both errors); file-sourced bodies get the same auto-link / auto-mention treatment as inline text.

### Output format

| Command type | Shape |
|--------------|-------|
| List | `{ "data": [...], "meta": { "count": N } }` |
| Single resource | Flat object |
| Error | `{ "error": "message" }` |

---

## Error Handling

1. **Check for `"error"` key** before accessing fields like `identifier`.
2. **Do NOT retry** failed commands — report the error.
3. Common errors and fixes:
   - "Label not found" → check `el-linear labels list --team X`.
   - "Label is a group label" → use a child label, not the parent.
   - "Project may not be associated with this issue's team" → fix with `el-linear projects add-team`.
   - "User not found" → check `el-linear users list --active`.

---

## Label Taxonomy

### Type Labels (Required: exactly 1)

The default el-linear validation expects one of these:

| Label | When |
|-------|------|
| `feature` | New functionality. |
| `bug` | Broken behavior. |
| `refactor` | Improving code without changing behavior. |
| `chore` | Maintenance, dependencies, tooling. |
| `spike` | Research or investigation. |

Customize the set per-config: `validation.typeLabels: ["feature", "bug", ...]`. Domain labels (`frontend`, `backend`, etc.) are not enforced — define your own.

### Title Verb Convention

Title must start with a verb that matches the type label:

- `bug` → Fix, Resolve, Patch, Handle, Address, Correct
- `feature` → Add, Build, Create, Implement, Enable, Ship, Launch, Design, Wire, Integrate
- `chore` → Update, Remove, Clean, Migrate, Deploy, Rotate, Configure, Document, Review, Publish, Standardize, Upgrade
- `spike` → Research, Investigate, Explore, Evaluate, Audit, Benchmark
- `refactor` → Refactor, Restructure, Extract, Decouple, Simplify

### Rules

- **Create missing labels liberally** — `el-linear labels create "my-label" --team ENG`.
- **`--claude` flag** adds the workspace-level "claude" label automatically.
- Ask the user to confirm labels if you're unsure about domain.

## Term Enforcement (`config.terms`)

el-linear can flag misspellings of brand or project names in titles and descriptions. Configure rules in `~/.config/el-linear/config.json`:

```json
{
  "terms": [
    { "canonical": "Enrich Layer", "reject": ["EnrichLayer", "enrichlayer"] },
    { "canonical": "Linear", "reject": ["linear.app", "Linear App"] },
    { "canonical": "GitHub", "reject": ["Github", "github"] }
  ]
}
```

When el-linear finds a rejected token in an issue title or description, it warns (or in `--strict` mode, throws). The check tolerates URLs and file paths — `enrichlayer.com` is allowed even though `enrichlayer` is rejected.

If you don't configure any rules, term enforcement is a no-op.

## Project Management Gotchas

### Content vs Description

Linear projects have two text fields — **both must be populated**:

- `description` — short summary (max 255 chars), shown in lists.
- `content` — full markdown body, shown in main panel.

If you only set one, the other shows blank.

### Cross-Team Projects

Creating an issue on team X with a project from team Y → "Project not in same team" error. Fix:

```bash
el-linear projects add-team "Project Name" ENG 2>&1
```

**Never use raw `projectUpdate` with `teamIds`** — it replaces the entire team list. Always use `projects add-team` / `remove-team`.

### Project Updates (status posts) — mind the naming collision

Linear has two unrelated things spelled almost the same:

- `projectUpdate(id, input)` — the mutation that **edits a project** (the one warned about just above). Surfaced by the `projects` command.
- `ProjectUpdate` — a **status post** in a project's Updates feed (progress + a health color). Surfaced by the dedicated `project-updates` command:

```bash
# Post a status update to a project (appears in the Updates feed)
el-linear project-updates create --project "Auth Refactor" \
  --body "Shipped the session-store migration; rollout at 60%." \
  --health onTrack   # onTrack | atRisk | offTrack — omit to leave unset

el-linear project-updates list --project "Auth Refactor"
el-linear project-updates read <updateId>
```

`--body` / `--body-file` are mutually exclusive (one required); `--body-file` avoids shell-quoting for markdown/tables. `--health` is validated against the enum before the API call. `--diff-hidden` hides the auto-generated progress diff on the update. `-q/--quiet` prints `<health>  <url>`. A status update is not the same as a project **document** (`documents create --project`) — use a document for durable reference content, a project update for point-in-time progress.

### Discovery Before Creation

Always check if a project exists before creating: `el-linear projects list`.

The CLI emits a `results_truncated` warning in `_warnings` when the result set hits `--limit` — bump `--limit` (the suggested next size is in the warning text) or narrow via `--name` / `--state` and retry. Linear URLs and bare slug-ids (`https://linear.app/<workspace>/project/<slug>-<12-hex>/...` or bare `<slug>-<12-hex>`) resolve directly when passed to `--project` — no need to extract a human-readable name yourself.

**If the user names a project that doesn't surface, do not substitute a different one.** Broaden the search (drop `--state` / `--active` / `--name` filters, then bump `--limit`); if it still doesn't appear, **ask** the user before falling back. Substituting a wrong project silently is worse than asking one extra question.

## Git/GitLab/GitHub Integration

If your Linear workspace is connected to a code host, status transitions happen automatically:

- Creating a PR/MR → linked issue moves to "In Review".
- Merging a PR/MR → linked issue moves to "Done".

No manual status updates needed after PR/MR events.

### Intermediate Deliverable Rule

**Any PR/MR whose branch contains an issue ID will auto-close that issue on merge.** This is dangerous for multi-phase issues where a PR delivers only part of the work.

**Rule:** if the PR doesn't complete ALL acceptance criteria of the parent issue, create a sub-issue and branch from that. The parent stays open.

```text
Parent: ENG-100 "Review API design"          ← stays open
  └─ Sub: ENG-101 "Write API design doc"     ← branch: feature/ENG-101-write-api-design-doc
                                                PR merges → only ENG-101 closes
```

## Checklist Progress Tracking

When working on an issue with a checklist, check off items as you complete them.

1. Read the issue: `el-linear issues read ENG-123`.
2. Update the description with checked items: `el-linear issues update ENG-123 --description "..."`.
3. Preserve the rest of the description — only change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`.
4. If all items are done, update the status accordingly.
